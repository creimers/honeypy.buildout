The Contract
===============

This is a contract in the sense of a convention! It's a convetion *about* configuration
not *over* configuration. It lives in a state of contradiction as long as this difference
is unclear. Thus, to give clarification, the principles o this contract are:

1. first
2. second

You are invited to freely use and follow this contract. You are pretty welcome 
to improve and evolve it by your contribution!

We want to encourage you to join this contract when using buildout, because...

* we want to design real scalable buildouts
