**honeypy.buildout** provides a **python web application build framework** to get the most
out of `zc.buildout. <http://buildout.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ Forget about building and deploying
your software -- honeypy.buildout will do most of the job. Take your time to **develop great python web applications with Plone, Django or Pyramid**!


.. warning::
    This project is in `pre alpha state. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle>`_ Anything can change from this point.

Project Target
--------------------

`back to top <index.html>`_

The **honeypy.buildout project** aims to provide a framework containing tools and best practices to 
build modular and reliable `configurations for the most popular python web frameworks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Python_web_application_frameworks>`_ on top of `zc.buildout. <http://buildout.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ They shall be packed in a framework to allow projects to be updated if additional or better configurations come in.

Those configurations should be...

* **simply reusable** - all reasonable configurations should fit into a single library, 
* **freely shareable** - if you know one honeypy.buildout, you know all of them,
* **effortlessly deployable** - shall work anywhere: on physical hosts, vm's, IAAS and PAAS,
* **easily scalable** - allows to grow from small hosts up to large distributed systems.
