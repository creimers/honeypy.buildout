**honeypy.buildout** provides a well defined **library of configuration patterns** to get the most
out of `zc.buildout. <http://buildout.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ Forget about building and deploying
your software, honeypy.buildout will do most of the job. Take your time to **develop great python web applications with Plone, Django or Pyramid**!


.. warning::
    This project is in `pre alpha state. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle>`_ Anything can change from this point.


--------------------
Project Target
--------------------

The **honeypy.buildout project** aims to provide a set of **best practices for 
building modular and reliable configurations** on top of `zc.buildout. <http://buildout.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

Those configurations should be...

* **simply reusable** - all reasonable configurations should fit into a single library, 
* **freely shareable** - if you know one honeypy.buildout, you know all of them,
* **effortlessly deployable** - shall work anywhere: on physical hosts, vm's, IAAS and PAAS,
* **easily scalable** - from small hosts up to large distributed systems.
