====================================
A buildout without cable spaghetti!
====================================

**honeypy.buildout** provides well defined configuration patterns to get the most
out of zc.buildout.

zc.buildout is a real flexible, easy to use and extendable software configuration
tool. It helps you to build small apps with a minimal need for configuration and
the big ones with many bells & whistles to configure as well.
